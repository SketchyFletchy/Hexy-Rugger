# Hex Mapper for Super Sweet Crochet work

Fletcher Thompson, 2019.

## Introduction

This is a tool for generating maps of various gradients of colour quantised over hexagonally packed regions and outputting them in a useful, readable format.

## Cool but for why?

Because I am working on a cool crocheted blanket for my friend made entirely of [hexagonal 'granny squares'](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EkSpiuQQy54&t=295s). I wanted to generate some cool patterns but quickly ran out of any desire to manually drag hexagons around in photoshop and wanted a bit of Python practice. Voila.
